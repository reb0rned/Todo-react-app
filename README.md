# Todo React App

## Project Description  
This is a simple yet functional Todo application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently — create, update, complete, filter, and delete todos. It fetches and syncs data with an external API, ensuring persistent task management.  

The project follows modern best practices, including component-based architecture, typed code with TypeScript, and responsive layout.

## Features  
- ✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- 📌 Filter tasks by status: All / Active / Completed  
- 🔄 Mark all as complete / clear completed  
- 🌐 Fetch todos from external API  
- ⚡ Fully typed with TypeScript  
- 🧩 Clean and modular structure using React functional components

## Technologies Used  
- **React** – For building UI components  
- **TypeScript** – For static typing and better developer experience  
- **Fetch API** – For communicating with backend (JSONPlaceholder or custom API)  
- **SCSS / CSS Modules** – For styling the app  
- **React Hooks** – For state and lifecycle management  
- **Vite / CRA / Webpack** – (Укажи сборщик, если хочешь)
